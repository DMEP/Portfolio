## An Intelligent Pick-and-Place Robot
3D printing provides a quick and affordable prototyping for designing new robots hence using this 
software this study designed and implement a pick and place robot with five degrees of freedom, controllable
through keyboard key presses and with the ability to remember what instructions it has been given in order to repeat actions.
The paper concludes with further work that allowed the user to control the robot manually with their hands rather than the keyboard keys.
