This module involved researching into the current advancements of computer science within certain fields such as Artificial Neural Networks.

## BCI and FNN Presentation
A presentation of the two paper that have been written.

## Brain Computer Interface
One area chosen for the assignment was Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI) with focus on nueroprosthtics and brain to brain (B2B) applications.
The paper introduces the basic and foundation of the subject, reviews the past literature and looks into the advances in research and applications, 
finally concluding with a critical reflection.

## Fuzzy Neural Networks
Another area was Fuzzy Logic Artificial Neural Network or Fuzzy Neural Networks (FNN) for short, which looked at the business and education systems 
that were being created.
The paper introduces the basic and foundation of the subject, reviews the past literature and looks into the advances in research and applications, 
finally concluding with a critical reflection.
