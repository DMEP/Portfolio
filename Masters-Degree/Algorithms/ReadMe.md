## Direct Policy Search for Deep Reinforcement Learning
A research paper investigating a direct policy search approach for deep reinforcement learning and presents
a scenario to be applied to, the process of designing an algorithm in order to implement such a system, 
as well as looking into the limitations to the chosen algorithm and the potential improvements. 
In conclusion this paper will discuss other similar research and real world applications that deep reinforcement 
learning can be applied to.
