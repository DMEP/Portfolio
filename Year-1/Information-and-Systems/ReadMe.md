This module was split into a database assignment and a spreadsheet assignment. The database assignment was to create a database that will hold the client details, the materials and the orders of a company called Microware.
The spreadsheet assignment was to allow the specialist to record the support they give electronically. The spreadsheet would be able to calculate many more features than their current paper based system.
