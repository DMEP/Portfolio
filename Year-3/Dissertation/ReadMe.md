Reinforcement Learning provides the opportunity to have a basic artificial intelligence learn without fixed 
programming or a person to teach it. In this thesis we research into the field of reinforcement learning and Q-Values, 
implement a program to show the different learning based on greedy or exploratory algorithm and allow the user to change
variable of the program itself to further explore the impact they have on learning.
