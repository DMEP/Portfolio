# Assignment Folder Contents
For this project it was decided that a game would be made to demonstrate an intelligent behavior. 
The chosen game was naughts and crosses, a two player turn-based game played by marking an X or O on a 3Ã—3 grid. 
The player who successfully marks three tiles with their allocated symbol in a row, column or diagonal wins. 
If neither player manages to mark their tiles then the game ends in a draw.
